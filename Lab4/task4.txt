A smart grammar and style checker requires both syntactic and dependency parsing, this kind of app moves beyond simple spell-checking
to offer nuanced feedback on writing clarity and complexity. Syntactic parsing helps identify parts of speech and phrase boundaries,
allowing the system to recognize issues like subjectâ€“verb disagreement, misplaced modifiers, or incorrect clause structures. Dependency 
parsing further enhances this by revealing the relationships between words, enabling the detection of subtle grammatical errors such as 
incorrect preposition use or ambiguous references. Beyond simple error detection, these parsers support stylistic suggestions by 
analyzing sentence complexity, passive constructions, and word dependencies that affect clarity and tone. Without parsing, grammar 
checkers would be limited to surface-level pattern matching, making them far less accurate in understanding and improving natural language writing.
Such tools are used in academic writing to maintain formality and coherence, in business communication to ensure professionalism, and in content
creation to improve readability and tone. Without syntactic and dependency parsing, these systems would rely only on shallow pattern matching, 
greatly reducing their ability to provide accurate grammatical corrections and stylistic improvements.
