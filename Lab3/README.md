We will create today a Question Answering system for Romanian using a pre-trained BERT 
model and the SQuAD dataset. 
Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is an English reading comprehension dataset, 
consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the 
answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading 
passage, or the question might be unanswerable. 
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a transformer-based 
machine learning technique for natural language processing developed by Google. It has 
several pre-trained models you can use, including for Romanian. 
Your task for this lab involves several steps: 
1. (0.9) Use a fined tuned pre-trained BERT model to predict answers to questions given 
by the user. 
2. (0.1) Translate the answer to Romanian using a freely available translation API.
